i<br>
think<br>
that I shall<br>
never see a poem<br>
lovely as a tree A tree<br>
whose hungry mouth is prest anginst<br>
the earth's sweet flowing breast.<br>
A tree that looks at god all day and<br>
lifts her leafy arms to pray,A tree that<br>
may in summer wear ,A nest of robins in her hair<br>
,upon whose bosom snow has lain who intimately lives <br>
with rain
poems are<br>
 made by<br>
 fools like<br>
 mebut only <br>
 god can <br>
make a tree <br>
